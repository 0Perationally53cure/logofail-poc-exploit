# LOGOFAIL POC

LogoFAIL is a proof-of-concept exploit designed to demonstrate the severity of the vulnerability present in the image parsers within UEFI firmware, specifically targeting the PNG parser. The exploit showcases how an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution during the firmware initialization phase (DXE phase) by leveraging an integer overflow in the PNG parser.

Features:

    Exploits the LogoFAIL vulnerability in UEFI firmware.
    Injects a payload into the firmware's memory during the parsing of a specially crafted PNG image.
    Hijacks control flow by corrupting core UEFI objects (PROTOCOL_ENTRY), enabling execution of the injected code.
    Tested and verified on various UEFI firmware implementations.
    RING 0 permissions.
